\description{
Set and get path to IARC CRG Tools executable.
}
\details{
The executable is attempted to be discovered automatically by
\code{\link{guess_tools_exe_path}} at start-up of this package, so with
any luck you don't need to set it by hand.

Executable path will be stored for the duration of the ongoing R session.
If this package is somehow unloaded or reloaded, the setting will reset.
